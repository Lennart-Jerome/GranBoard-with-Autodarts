# GranBoard with Autodarts

**GranBoard with Autodarts** is a userscript (Tampermonkey) that connects a **GranBoard via Bluetooth (BLE)** directly to **Autodarts** and automatically enters throws.

The script intelligently detects **how inputs must be entered in Autodarts** and automatically switches between **keyboard input** and **board view**, depending on the current game mode.

- ✅ PC or laptop **with Bluetooth**
- ✅ Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge

## 🧠 How does the script work?

### 🔁 AutoView logic (recommended)

For **every throw**, the script checks which input method Autodarts allows:

| Situation | Action |
|---------|--------|
Number keypad available | Input via keyboard
No numbers (e.g. Bobs27) | Automatic switch to board view
Board view active | Direct click on the dartboard

The current mode is shown in the overlay.
